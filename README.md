# Software Engineering for Business Innovation

## Introduction

Our meetup aims to bring together business and software professionals concerned with realizing new and revenue generating products and business units involving newly conceived and constructed software systems.

There is now an enduring and growing reasonable convergence on the operative principles of communications, collaboration, design and tool use - "systems thinking" - across business and software construction and value creation.

We are NOT MATHS FOCUSED, but this meetup will help participants understand, internalize and fruitfully apply the following propositions in an accessible fashion:

  * Abstracting away from luck and material science, computing and business are both arenas of creative applied mathematics.
  * Abstracting away from ever evolving compute hardware, collaborating teams of regular human beings are the "material science" applying any such mathematics.

  * Mathematical semantics underwrite heuristic decision support analogic business models - such as trend analyses, forecasting and target market definition.

  * Mathematical semantics underwrite generative models of software realization - such as compilers, protocols, processes and systems.
  
  * Mathematical semantics underwite the team communications and process logic of both business and software structure, design, planning, scheduling, and realization.

Our meetup participants will read and discuss well written, iconic and appropriately concise articles by storied contributors to this tradition which so many now apply for rewarding careers and handsome profits.

Together, meetup participants will help each other cut through the routine hype, separate signal from noise and better get down to business.

## What is This About?

  * Growing collaborating, generative product development teams
  * Defining and reaching problem domains, solution domains, target markets for new business value
  * Profitably realizing revenue generating software systems
  * Communicating using tools, langauges and shared regimented practices
  * Prioritizing, scheduling and iterating business realization
  

## What is This Not (explicity, at least) About?

  * Learning the latest industry toolset
  * Making technology purchase decisions
  * Deploying office automation or packaged business software
  * Maintaining legacy record keeping systems
  * Outsourcing cost center business functions

## Why Participate?

  * Meet cool smart people, maybe even future partners, team members or employers
  * Learn  the common language of enduring and applicable principles and skills across ever evolving and even faddish technology tool sets and business tactics
  * Converge on a shared set of assumptions and processes that better assure efficient and successful project execution
  * Realistically evaluate companies and teams for their likely success

## First Six Month Planned Bi-Weekly Readings

Our meetup will meet every two weeks near a Washington DC Metro stop.

If attendance surpases 20 members, we'll try to schedule alternative times and places but keep the same reading schedule.

The readings are enduring in popularity, short, non-technical and concise.

We hope to use freely available literature when possible.

Many of these concise articles or book chapters are backed up by lenthier case study analysis, which participants might consume at will time permitting.
